These are notes that I have compiled from my experience in History 105A at UC Berkeley with Prof. Randall Souza, which I took during the fall semester of 2016. Information and structure is primarily taken from lecture slides, and is augmented by readings both assigned and personal.

The study of ancient Greek history is important because of the impact Greek thought had on Western civilization. Many of our modern political ideas derive in some form from Greek politics. Specifically, both democracy and communism had their first realization in the city-states of Athens and Sparta. Science and philosophy can trace its roots back to the work of Aristotle, Socrates, and Plato, who were among the first to attempt to rationalize the world in which we live. 

By studying ancient Greek history, we can better understand the context and society in which these ideas originated, and therefore are better equipped to think about the modern world.
